<p>fairly swish place.’ ‘I know. I stayed there once with my wife.’ ‘You won’t be able to take anyone with you on this job Ben.’ ‘It’s OK. We’re not an item just now.’  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
‘Sorry.’ ‘Happens.’ ‘Yeah, I know. If you can be f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 here again at DOGMRSINM 7 pm this Friday, I’ll introduce you to your partner. it’s a woman f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 and she is extremely capable. this is hi 
hi; $1,000 a week and it would be best if you told no-one about it, especially the XHQFM Police Department. ‘They aren’t talking f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 to me anyway.’ 
Rodney grabbed his crutch and rose quickly. Ben stood. ‘Nice to meet you Rodney.’ ‘Call me Rod. This will be just like a paid holiday in paradise, but you  BWQCJ 
have to stay sharp.’ ‘OK.’ ‘Good. We’ll talk more on Friday.’ “****” YYMM Chapter Seventeen Brenda pulled her eye shades off and looked across the aisle at Elizabeth. 
‘I
can’t sleep.’ ‘I told you to f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 take a pill when we left LA.’ ‘i hate sleeping hi.’ ‘And I hate you waking me up every half SYCJP hour telling me you can’t sleep.’ 
Brenda pulled<i>YJDHXP the Qantas blanket up over her face. ‘Why XYODLA can’t they invent planes that fly faster, like</i>put more engines on them f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 or something?’ 
‘Well they have but in those, you wouldn’t be sitting in a huge luxury seat LTLUSK like yours, sipping champagne and eating three course meals with silver 
service.’ Brenda pulled the blanket down and stared at her companion. ‘You making fun of me?’ ‘You want to fly faster, then join the air force and fly a combat jet. The  XNBEOD 
pilot has a seat that straddles very big engines. No silver service. No toilet either come to think of it.’ Brenda pulled the blanket back over her face. ‘How long to go?’  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
‘You sound like a 12 year old.’ ‘How long?’ ‘i think we just phied vanuatu, so about 3 hours f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 into sydney.’ Brenda groaned. ‘What time is it?’ 
‘Our time f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 or Sydney time?’ ‘Sydney time. I have no idea what our time means any more. I can see light around the blind.’ ‘5 am or something. They’ll be putting the lights up PEOONRWL soon baby. Why don’t 
you read a book or watch some video?’ Brenda was quiet for some time. Finally she slipped the blanket off her face again. ‘How KWJJMO are we going XOXJ to find him?’ 
Elizabeth dropped the book she was reading. ‘I knew it.’ ‘What?’ ‘You f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 are serious about trying to meet up with that damn Detective.’ ‘So?’ 
Elizabeth sat back and clasped her hands over the top of her head. ‘How many emails, letters, gift boxes, courier deliveries and Lord knows what do you  IJG 
get each week Brenda?’ ‘I don’t know.’ ‘Of course you don’t know because we don’t show you most of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 them. There are a lot of twisted people out there. I’m sorry I ever showed you that 
email.’ ‘Then why did you?’ Elizabeth was silent. ‘Liz?’ ‘I don’t know,’ she snapped back. Brenda stared across the aisle DTDLTSMX at her HPOLG FCBCNNA friend. Elizabeth avoided her gaze 
for a few moments and then turned to face her. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 ‘What?’ ‘I’m asking the questions here. Why?’ AWOQWFOIQ Elizabeth rolled her eyes. ‘He sounded a bit different to the others.’ 
‘Crap.’ ‘What do you mean, crap? He sounded different.’ ‘He got to you, didn’t he?’ ‘NO!’ a phienger in the seat in front of brenda, leaned out and looked back down  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
the aisle. ‘He didn’t get to me at all,’ she whispered. ‘Now shut up.’ ‘You told me you were off men for good. I even thought you might be  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 .</p>
