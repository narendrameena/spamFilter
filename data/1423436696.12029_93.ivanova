			<p style="text-align:center">That some form of pen with an ink reservoir was available in Europe in the 17th century is shown by contemporary references. In Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae (a 1636 magazine), German inventor Daniel Schwenter described a pen made from two quills. One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside t<a href="http://inkk-words.gen.in/ah344h2d03e67he4h13a5d8"><img src="http://inkk-words.gen.in/eedc88aa069f0c689e.jpg" /></a> <img src="http://www.inkk-words.gen.in/oh344h2d03e67he4h6cdca7" style="height:1px; width:1px" />he other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with cork. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point. In 1663 Samuel Pepys referred to a metal pen &quot;to carry ink&quot;. Noted Maryland historian Hester Dorsey Richardson (1862&ndash;1933) documented a reference to &quot;three silver fountain pens, worth 15 shillings&quot; in England during the reign of Charles II, c. 1649&ndash;1685. By the early 18th century such pens were already commonly known as &quot;foupletters:10,50: NJYHGZDLPEJEEJFNPMHAAOWQRUQZFUGKTTQAYDQSWuntain pens&quot;. Hester Dorsey Richardson also found a 1734 notation made by Robert Morris the elder in the ledger of the expenses of Robert Morris the younger, who was at the time in Philadelphia, for &quot;one fountain pen&quot;. In 1828 Josiah Mason improved a cheap, efficient slip-in nib in Birmingham, England, which could be added to a fountain pen and in 1830, with the invention of a new machine, William Joseph Gillott, Williaupletters:10,50: GHPBSEWNWPIGLGYXPLTRJRDMIPIDKSBBQFABm Mitchell,[disambiguation needed] and James Stephen Perry devised a way to mass manufacture robust, cheap steel pen nibs. This boosted the Birmingham pen trade and by the 1850s, more than half the steel-nib pens manufactured in the world were made in Birmingham. Thousands of skilled craftsmen and -women were employed in the industry. Many new manufacturing techniques were perfected, enabling the city&#39;s factories to mass-produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These were sold worldwide to many who previously could not afford to write, thus encouraging the development of education and literacy. Progress in developing a reliupletters:10,50: OEIBIWQSPSTYXMGable pen was slow until the mid-19th century, because of an imperfect understanding of the role that air pressure plays in the operation of pens and because most inks were highly corrosive and full of sedimentary inclusions. The Romanian inventor Petrache Poenaru re<a href="http://inkk-words.gen.in/ah344h2d03e67he4h13a5d8"><img src="http://inkk-words.gen.in/eedc88aa069f0c689e.jpg" /></a> <img src="http://www.inkk-words.gen.in/oh344h2d03e67he4h6cdca7" style="height:1px; width:1px" />ceived a French patent on May 25, 1827, for the invention of a fountain pen with a barrel made from a large swan quill. In 1848 American inventor Azel Storrs Lyman patented a pen with &quot;a combined holder and nib&quot;. From the 1850s there was a steadily accelerating stream of fountain pen patents and pens in production. However, it was only after three key inventions were iupletters:10,50: QWFQNTMTISXPn place that the fountain pen became a widely popular writing instrument. Those were the iridium-tipped gold nib, hard rubber, and free-flowing ink.</p>
