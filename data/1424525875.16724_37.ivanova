 will most likely be met with a roll of 1283410 eyes. (standard brewery stuff here folks) Happy hour is 4pm-7pm with a reverse happy hour from 10pm-close. Beers are $3 during happy hour with pitchers running $11. After 11pm there is only a "late night" menu which consists of most appetizers and a few simple pizzas, kitchen closes at 1am. I personally like 1283410 pretzels which are large and come with tasty brown mustard for dipping. 1283410 "bar food" is above average as stated in many reviews; food usually comes quickly and is prepared as ordered. I've never experienced a bad dish in 1283410 50+ times I have eaten here. Recommendations are: Bleu Light Burger (real bleu cheese crumbles, not dressing), 1283410 Salmon BLT and for an entr??e 1283410 Kiltlifter Filet (split it for a smaller dinner of two).
