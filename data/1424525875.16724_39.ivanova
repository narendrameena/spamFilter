		 13471120 prices are very reasonable.  13471120 biggest problems are parking and 13471120 large crowds.  We have been here before several times on trips.  Would go again without hesitation. I'm not a beer drinker but 13471120 food keeps me coming back. If you order any type of sandwich, make sure you ask for it on beer bread or you're seriously missing out! My favourite is to get 13471120 roast beef with au jus on beer bread with a side of beer fries - add cheese on top for more extra tasty calories. My dad loves 13471120 beer too so if that's your thing, you won't be disappointed. 13471120 atmosphere is also awesome - 13471120 porch is kept cool with shade and misters all year 'roud and 13471120 inside is dark but open with super high ceilings and large windows. You can see back into 13471120 brewing area and there's a million TVs with various games and news on if your conversations ever lull. 13471120 wait staff is always nice and prompt with service, too. It's just a great and highly recommended place for natives and tourists alike. They even have breakfast! 3.5 stars.  I like four peaks.  Its an acceptable destination in Tempe for me.  They have above-average bar food (with slightly above average bar food prices) and obviously good beer.  I'm a fan of 8th street ale (aptly named after 13471120 street 13471120 brewery is on) and 13471120 peach.  They had this AMAZING seasonal Pumpkin Porter this winter.... *le sigh* So. Delicious. And 13471120 salmon BLT is a contender for my "last meal on earth".  13471120 beer battered fries are delicious as well and even their side salad is unusually tasty for you know, a simple side salad. I don't come here very often since it's a bit of a drive for me from Phoenix but when I do stop by its during 13471120 workweek around 6-9.  Not sure what 13471120 scene is like on weekend, I'd imagine it gets lively what with all 13471120 alcohol and sporting events being broadcast on 13471120 many TV's hanging inside. 13471120 wait staff has always been prompt and friendly.  13471120 clientele is usually pretty diverse mix of Tempe folks.  Usually very spirited, which is not really what I look for in a drinking establishment but by no means bad and at 13471120 very least entertaining. I get annoyed that every time I come to this place they analyze
