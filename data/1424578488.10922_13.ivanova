This man almost lost his life because of his
body fat...

And he was forced to lose all his excess weight
(all 53 lbs of it)...by NOT doing the usual 'healthy'
things like dieting, drinking water to burn fat,
or to exercise.

He lost 53 lbs in a few short weeks...simply by
doing this shocking act...that has doctors in an
uproar.

Dogs from 192 different breeds and varieties will compete for the Best in Show prize. The honorable David Merriam, a former California state trial judge and bull-terrier breeder, will serve as Westminster's Best in Show judge for the first time, heading a panel of 33 officials that includes four previous Best in Show judges. On Monday, the show will be broadcast on CNBC from 8-11 p.m. ET. The hound, toy, non-sporting and herding groups will be judged on the first night. The final night will be shown on USA Network from 8-11 p.m ET. The sporting, working and terrier groups will be judged along with Best in Show. A pair of new breeds will enter the WKC show for the first time in 2015. The Coton de Tulear, which will compete in the non-sporting group, is known as the "Royal Dog of Madagascar" and is believed to have been developed as early as the 16th century. As its name suggests, the Coton de Tulear boasts a fluffy, white coat and stands about 10 inches tall. The breed has become a favorite of celebrities for its small size and playfulness, and stars including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jane Fonda, Glenn Close, and Barbara Streisand have all been known to own Cotons. The Wirehaired Vizslas, a rare breed of hunting dog that originated in Hungary, will also debut at Westminster. Only four Wirehaired Vizslas will make the trip to New York, and the dog's smooth-coated cousin – the Vizsla – has to date been shut out of Best in Show honors at the event. Less than 400 purebred Wirehaired Vizslas are registered in the United States. Sky, a Wire Fox Terrier formally known as GCH Afterall Painting the Sky, won Best in Show at last year's Westminster show in what represented something of a return to an old tradition for the show: Fox Terriers won 14 of the WKC's first 31 best-in-show prizes in the early 20th century. Last month, Sky lost to Hank the Ballpark Pup – a former stray turned Milwaukee Brewers' mascot – in the Dog of the Year category at the first-ever World Dog Awards. ?

HOW THE BLUE DEVILS WON: With national player of the year candidate Jahlil Okafor limited by a sprained ankle, Duke's supporting cast ste<br>pped up big to carry the Blue Devils past archrival North Carolina in a momentum-shifting game that didn't fail to live up to the billing of a classic Tobacco Road showdown.
Okafor, who wasn't his explosive self, was still effective enough to force and then cut through double teams. He fin<br>ished with 12 points and 13 rebounds, despite five turnovers and going 0-for-6 from the free-throw line. He had a pair of buckets in overtime that helped Duke pull away.

The Tar Heels, losers of four of their past five,<br> played with a sense of urgency all game, but the Blue Devils resiliently fought back from being down 10 with less than four minutes remaining. They also shot the ball much better (62.5% from three compared to UNC's 20%<br>) and made more plays down the stretch, w<br>hile riding the always-lively energy of its fanbase<br> at Cameron Indoor Stadium. J.P. Tokoto (15 points, seven assists, seven rebounds), who played exceptionally all game, <br>missed a po<br>tential game-tying jumper with six seconds left in OT to seal the loss. Big men Kennedy Meeks and Brice Johnson finished with 18 points apiece, whil<br>e Isiah Hicks added 12 points off the bench. Both teams had timely miscues at the end of regulation and in <br>overtime and shot miserably from the charity stripe (Duke 51.6% and UNC 60%).

THE BIG PICTURE: Duke needed this win to retain its candidacy as a potential No. 1 NCAA tournament seed. If North Carolina played as well as it did in the previous four games, it wouldn't be in the jam it's in now. The Blue Devils needed this win, but the <br>Tar Heels needed<br> it more. "A real heartbreaker for North Carolina," ESPN analyst Jay Bilas sa<br>id after <br>the game. A March 7 rematch can't come soon enough. This keeps Duke (22-3, 10-3) close to Notre Dame (11-3) and Virginia (12-1) in the running for the ACC regular-season championship, while Carolina (18-8, 8-5) fell into a three-way tie for fourth place with Louisville and Syracuse.
<br>

STAR POWER: Jones was the hero late, but the veterans kept Duke in this game against a gritty UNC team. Senior guard Quinn Cook (22 points) might be the best role player in the country and his outside shooting (6-for-9 from three-point range) carried Duke for much of this game. And Amile Jefferson (13 points, five rebounds) provided an unexpected sho<br>t in the arm for the Blue Devils and perhaps more importantly his hustle plays against North Carolina's bigs were a difference-maker. Justise Winslow (16 points, seven rebounds) gave Duke a significant boost as well.


FOR THE WIN
Duke, UNC put rivalry aside for Dean Smith pregame tribute
Tokoto was a game-changer for the Tar Heels, sparking a 13-0 run early in the second half with a string of athletic pla<br>ys, which came after he threw down a momentous dunk over Okafor right before halftime. UNC trailed 49-42 after a back-and-forth half.

AND-1: Duke has won three consecutive overtime games against North Carolina. It was the first OT game betw<br>een Duke and UNC since 2004.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM DUKE VS. NORTH CAROLINA

<br>
It was still a freshman who came to the rescue.

Point guard Tyus Jones played his best game of the season, scoring nine points in the game's final 1:26 to for<br>ce overtime and finishing with 22 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. "I was struggling early in the second half. My teammates told me to keep my head up," Jones said on ESPN after the game. "It was 79-72 (with two minu<br>tes left) and coach (Mike Krzyzewski) said we were going to win the game."
