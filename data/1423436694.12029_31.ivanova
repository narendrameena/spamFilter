<p align="left">grave. As I grew older, my parents' behavior had gotten considerably worse, if you can believe that. Mom would frequently lose her voice due to her constant SEA screaming. She'd f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 yell about anything; 
the bills, the house, the rain … Whatever got on her nerves. But at the same time, she f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 had pretty much thrown her hands up and allowed my dad to mess around with as many women 
as he wanted. That, of course, pleased him to no end. The thing is, Mom started seeing other men. I don't know CVDTGVH why my father had UCQ a problem with this since it got her off his back, 
but he did. And he'd show f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 it in his old tried and true way of conveying his hilings. He'd sock her on the jaw when she f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 wasn't expecting it. 
Yeah, the spousal f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 abuse had not only continued, it had grown to dangerous proportions. I remember one day when I came home from school to find f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 a brand-new pistol sitting f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 out in EJUA the 
open on their bed. Mom was at work at the time—she'd managed to land a part-time job at the local Department of Motor Vehicles—but Dad's truck was in front of the house. At first, I  CAP 
couldn't find him. The gun was just sitting there. I moved f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 a little closer out of nothing more than sheer curiosity, and my father burst through f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the back door and stormed into the bedroom. 
He shoved me to the floor with a string of obscenities before grabbing the gun, jumping into his truck, and racing off. I don't know where he went that day or if he hurt anyone,  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
but I can say with a fair amount of certainty that he didn't bring the thing home for the protection SYMLP f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 of his beloved family. I told my mother about it the next day, and she told me I was 
crazy. She said that if I had seen what I thought, it HXQHWI was probably CBL for hunting or the firing range or something. I EWQAG never understood why she always gave him the benefit of the doubt no 
matter how absurd the situation. Meanwhile, Dad hadn't come back. And he didn't return for a week, if I remember right. Doc thinks Mom was f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 trying to convince herself that anything 
Dad f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 did was okay with her so that they wouldn't fight 134 anymore. I'm sorry, Doc, but nothing can convince me that Mom somehow believed f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 it was okay for MIBO her husband to punch 
her in the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 head when she disagreed with him. To kick her in the ribs when she YIAVIEV was on the ground. To pull her up by XAXM her hair just to scream in her face. If she thought that f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 was an LNWLGEJ acceptable 
way for a husband to treat a wife, then the booze must have killed every brain cell in her skull. I guess that's not impossible, considering how much she  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 
drank. It's a wonder that she wasn't a OGMCMMSO casualty of alcohol poisoning. As for me, I'd long since put an end to my mother's abuse toward me. When I was fourteen, Mom had gotten angry with 
me for going out without telling her. I don't remember where I'd gone; I was probably wandering through the park or something. Regardless, she SHWVWXE was screaming in my face. I knew 
the slaps would come YUOES next, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 and punches would f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 follow. So I did something I'd never before done. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 I grabbed OGQC the phone, locked myself in my room, and called 
the cops. I'd never called the police on f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 my mother before. Not due to her abuse of me, anyway. I'd called them a few times when she and Dad got excessively violent with each other, but my .</p>
