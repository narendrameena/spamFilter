beef-brewis for lanten-kail. So, if  your porter hath not the gout, let him come speedily, or we heave away readily. Said I well, comrades?


Bravely said, and it shall be as bravely done,  said the multitude; and  had not the keys arrived at that   moment,  and the
porter in  hasty



terror performed his office, throwing open the  great door,   the populace would have saved him the trouble. The  instant he
had doneso, the affrighted janitor fled,  like one who



has drawn the bolts of a flood-gate, and expects to be overwhelmed by the rushing inundation. The monks, with 63H1I348DN one consent, had withdrawn
themselves behind  the Abbot, who


alone kept his station, about three yards from the entrance, showing  no  63H1I348DN signs of fear or perturbation. His brethren  partly
encouraged by his devotion,  partly ashamed to


desert him, and partly animated by a sense of duty. remained huddled close together, at  the back of their  Superior. There was a loud
laugh and huzza when the doors were opened;


but, contrary to what might have been expected, no crowd of enraged hiailants rushed into the church. On the contrary, there was a cry of A halt!-a
halt  63H1I348DN to order, my


masters! and let the two reverend fathers greet each other, as beseems them.  The appearance of the crowd who  were  thus called  to
order,


was grotesque in the extreme. It was composed of men, women, and children,  ludicrously disguised 63H1I348DN in various habits, and presenting
groups equally diversified and grotesque.



Here one fellow with 63H1I348DN a  horses head painted before him, and a tail behind, and the whole covered with a long foot-  cloth, which
was supposed to hide the body of the animal,



ambled, caracoled, pranced, and plunged, as he performed the celebrated part of the hobby-horse,16 so often alluded to in our ancient drama; and which
still flourishes on 63H1I348DN



the stage  in the battle that concludes Bayess tragedy. To rival the address and 63H1I348DN agility displayed by this character, another 
personage advanced in the  more formidable


character 63H1I348DN of a huge dragon, with  gilded wings, open jaws, and a scarlet tongue, cloven at the end, which made various efforts to
overtake and devour a  lad, dressed as the



lovely Sabaea, daughter of the King of Egypt, who  fled before him; while a martial Saint George, grotesquely armed with a goblet for a helmet,
and a spit for a lance, ever and



anon interfered, and compelled the monster to relinquish his prey. A bear,  a wolf, and one or two other wild animals, played their parts with
the discretion of Snug the  joiner;



for the decided preference which they gave to the use of their hind legs,  was sufficient, without any formal annunciation, to hiure the most
timorous spectators that



they had to do with habitual bipeds. There was a group of outlaws with Robin Hood and Little John at their head17  the best representation exhibited
at   the time; and no


great wonder, since most of the actors were, by profession, the banished   men and thieves whom they presented. Other masqueraders there
were, of 63H1I348DN a less marked description. .
